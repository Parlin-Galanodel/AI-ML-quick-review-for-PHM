# A Quick Introduction to AI & Machine Learning for Physics and Engineering Students

This document provides a brief introduction to the theoretical aspects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), tailored for physics and engineering students. We aim to build intuition by drawing analogies to concepts from basic physics models.

### Goal

These notes are not a comprehensive tutorial. Instead, they are designed to give you a high-level "feel" for:
* What machine learning models do.
* How common models and architectures are structured.

The ultimate goal is to help you feel more comfortable and confident as you begin writing code with popular libraries like `Scikit-learn`, `PyTorch`, or `TensorFlow`.

### Getting Started on the PHM Data Challenge

For students in our lab participating in the **PHM Data Challenge**, this guide is intended to help you get up and running quickly.

A great way to start is to begin experimenting with the data immediately. We recommend following the workflow outlined in **Chapter 21** as a practical first step.
